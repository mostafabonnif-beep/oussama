## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Production deployment guide for the current DZ HOOF Docker Compose stack, health endpoints, backups, rollback, and release operations.
- Request IDs in API error and 404 responses for safer support diagnostics.

### Changed

- Unified Android release workflow around the `com.dzhoof.iptv` application, HTTPS `DZHOOF_API_URL`, DZ HOOF artifact names, and GitHub Releases.
- Updated project status and setup documentation to reflect current test coverage and Next.js production validation.

### Security

- CI now fails on high-or-above production dependency vulnerabilities and cancels obsolete runs.
