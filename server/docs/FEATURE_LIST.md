## Smart Stream Grouping & Auto-Fallback

- IPTV-org channels grouped by channel ID in import UI (multiple streams per logical channel)
- Stream ranking algorithm: liveness (alive > unknown > dead) > quality (1080p > 720p > 480p > SD) > response speed
- Best stream auto-selected during import, admin can override via expandable row with radio buttons
- Alternate streams stored on Channel model (`alternateStreams[]`) with quality, liveness, userAgent, referrer
- Grouped import endpoint creates channels with primary + alternates in one operation
- Channel detail modal shows alternate streams with promote button (swap alternate to primary)
- Bad stream flagging system: users can report streams as looping, frozen, wrong-content, or other
- Flag reasons recorded with user, timestamp; admins can clear flags
- Flagging available for both primary and alternate streams
- Fallback API endpoint (`/channels/:id/with-fallbacks`) returns only alive, non-flagged alternates
- User playlist fallback endpoint (`/user-playlist/me/channels-with-fallbacks`) for Android app
- M3U playlist generation auto-substitutes alive non-flagged alternate when primary is dead or flagged
- Stream health scheduler task (default: 4 hours) probes primary streams, auto-promotes best alive non-flagged alternate
- Flagged streams excluded from auto-promotion and export

## Stream Proxy

- Proxy HLS/DASH streams through the server to avoid client CORS issues
- VLC user agent for upstream requests to maximize compatibility
- M3U8 manifest rewriting: converts all relative URLs to absolute
- M3U8 manifest rewriting: rewrites all URLs to route through proxy
- Binary media segments (.ts files) piped directly without rewriting
- 30-second timeout with up to 5 redirects
- CORS headers added to all proxied responses
- Upstream timeout returns 504, other errors return 502
- SSRF protection: validates URLs before fetching, blocks redirects to private/internal addresses

## TV Stream Proxy

- TV-code-authenticated stream proxy at `GET /api/v1/tv/stream/:code?url=<stream_url>`
- Mirrors full stream proxy behavior (HLS manifest rewriting, VLC user agent, SSRF protection) but authenticated via channel list code in URL path instead of session
- HLS manifest URLs rewritten to route through the TV proxy endpoint
- Android TV app uses this as fallback when direct stream playback fails
- Proxy URL constructed from server URL + TV code + encoded stream URL

## Alternate Stream Fallback (Android TV)

- Android TV app receives up to 3 alternate stream URLs per channel via `GET /channels` response
- Alternates filtered server-side: dead and flagged streams excluded, capped at 3, slimmed to `{streamUrl, quality}`
- ErrorRecoveryManager uses a StreamSlot queue for multi-URL retry with proxy fallback per URL
- Retry strategy per channel: primary direct (2x) → primary proxy (1x) → alt1 direct (1x) → alt1 proxy (1x) → alt2 ... → dead
- Maximum 9 recovery attempts with 3 alternates (3 + 2 + 2 + 2), fewer if no proxy available
- Alternates cached in-memory in ChannelRepositoryImpl (not persisted to Room DB — no migration needed)
- Cold start with empty cache degrades gracefully to primary-only retry
- When an alternate stream plays successfully for 10 seconds, the app reports the working `streamUrl` via `POST /channels/:id/report-play`
- Server auto-promotes the working alternate to primary: swaps `channelUrl`, demotes old primary to alternates with `liveness.status = dead`
- Promotion is idempotent: multiple devices reporting the same alternate converge to the same state
- `RecoveringOverlay` progress indicator reflects actual max attempts based on available slots

## Image Proxy

- User mode: add from system pool, remove, M3U playlist URL copy, client-side sorting/filtering, Quick Pick link
- External Sources: admin sees liveness stats bar, batch liveness check, and replace-existing option; user sees simplified import to personal list
- Import IPTV: admin has liveness testing, batch check, replace existing, and raw data in detail modal; user has auto-select-all and import to personal list
- Follows the WizardShell pattern established by Quick Pick for role-based component sharing

- Displays per-channel stats: alive/dead status, play count, last played timestamp
- Richer table layout with logo, channel name, category, and health indicators
- Admin can manage (add/remove) a user's assigned channels directly from the user detail page

## TV Pairing Rate Limiting

- Dedicated lower-threshold rate limiter on the pairing status polling endpoint
- Prevents TV devices from hammering the status endpoint during pairing flow
- Rate limit is separate from the global API rate limiter to avoid blocking other traffic

## Channel Ownership & Playlist Privacy

- Channels carry an `ownerId`: `null` = shared admin catalog, a user id = that user's private channel
- User M3U/Xtream imports create private channels owned by the importer — never pooled into the shared catalog
- Private playlist URLs (which may embed subscription credentials) are hidden from admins and the public demo
- Admin catalog views, stats, category counts, and the M3U export are scoped to catalog channels only
- Admin catalog re-import/wipe (`replaceExisting`/delete-all) affects only catalog channels; users' private channels are preserved
- `channelId` uniqueness is per-owner (compound index), so different users can import the same channel independently
- Import dedup is scoped per user, so re-importing a playlist won't create duplicates
- "Browse Demo Channels" pairs to a dedicated `DEMO_CHANNEL_LIST_CODE`; the admin/TV channel sync is bounded by `TV_CHANNELS_MAX`
- One-time migration backfills ownership with conservative attribution and guarantees no user loses channels

## Database Growth Prevention & Serving Performance

- EPG ingest bounded to `EPG_MAX_LOOKAHEAD_HOURS` (default 48h) ahead — upstream guides carrying ~6 days no longer bloat storage
- Noisy audit actions (`test_channel*`, `check_liveness*`) are no longer persisted; audit retention tightened to 180 days (TTL)
- Scheduled task-run history auto-expires after 30 days (TTL); redundant indexes dropped from channels/iptv-org/audit collections
- Optional scheduler step prunes stale dead cache streams after each liveness sweep (`DEAD_STREAM_PRUNE_ENABLED`, `DEAD_STREAM_PRUNE_DAYS`)
- Migration `npm run migrate:sync-indexes` reconciles live indexes with the schemas on deploy (dry-run by default, `--commit` to apply)

## Import Hygiene: Categorization, Clubbing & Dedup

- M3U imports without `group-title` resolve a category from the iptv-org cache (by tvg-id, then name), then from name patterns (series `S01 E09`, movies `(2021)`, genre keywords, `DE:`-style country prefixes) before falling back to `Uncategorized`
- Multiple streams sharing a tvg-id are clubbed into one channel with `alternateStreams` (capped at 50) instead of duplicate rows
- Admin catalog imports skip URLs already present in the catalog, so re-imports no longer create duplicate channels
- EXTINF titles are extracted after the attribute list (not the first comma), so attribute values containing commas (Cloudinary logo URLs, user-agent strings) no longer corrupt channel names

## Channel Serving: Caching, Payloads & Limits

- Shared catalog responses (`/channels`, `/channels/grouped`, `/playlist.m3u`) and rendered EPG (XMLTV + JSON) are Redis-cached with invalidation on catalog mutations
- Channel list endpoints return a whitelisted field set verified against what the TV app and web frontend actually read (~40% smaller payloads)
- M3U playlist generation streams via a lean cursor instead of hydrating the full catalog in memory
- Auth middleware fetches only the user fields it needs; every channel list response is bounded by `TV_CHANNELS_MAX`
- Per-user channel lists are capped at `USER_CHANNELS_MAX` (default 5000) additions; admins can set `allCatalog` on a user to serve them the whole shared catalog instead
